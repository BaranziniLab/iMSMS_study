# Gut Microbiome Study in Multiple Sclerosis
Computational pipelines for the study of gut microbiome in MS via the international Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study ([iMSMS](imsm.org) ). iMSMS is the largest and most comprehensive study of the gut microbiome in MS to date. Here we presented a study in 576 subjects with MS (76% with relapse-remitting MS and 24% with progressive MS; 36% untreated), and genetically unrelated household healthy controls (1152 subjects in total). The aim of this study is to understand the role of commensal bacteria in MS risk by discovering associations with microbiome features.
